I am writing on behalf of the *GDG Club of IILM University* since we are hosting a thrilling *24-hour Hackathonâ€”an event that has already received more than **1200+ registrations, with **300+ students* likely to be attending on the last day. This will provide an excellent chance for {comp_name}, to interact with a very engaged and technology-friendly audience.

We would be more than happy to have *{comp_name}*, as one of our main sponsors!

By collaborating with us, {comp_name},would enjoy *considerable exposure and brand visibility* through:

- *Direct interaction with 300+ students* on the event day
- *Branding on-site opportunities*: Flyers, banners, and posters
- *Social media promotion: We will post and share **specific reels and shoutouts* on our Instagram and LinkedIn accounts
- Your *prominent logo* on all event-related documents, including flyers, posters, and digital advertising

We think your platform fits in beautifully with the developer-first ethos of the event, and we'd love to introduce your brand to a crowd of future engineers, developers, and tech leaders.

Looking forward to the chance to work together. Let us know if you'd be interested in chatting more about thisâ€”we'd be delighted to provide more information and sponsorship options.
